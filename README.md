# mesacomplex2.0
a reworked, recoded mesacomplex.

unfucked files, cleaner designs*, better UX.

other marketing sentences with frequent buzzwords.

ok actually though- made with the intent of replacing the main mesacomplex website, as it had gotten very, *very* cluttered. it was also getting difficult to add new things just due to the sheer ammount of things already there, including tons of garbage games nobody played bloating file sizes.
